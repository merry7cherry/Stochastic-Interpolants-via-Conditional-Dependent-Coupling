# Stochastic-Interpolants-via-Conditional-Dependent-Coupling
A unified multistage generative framework using a Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes generation into interpolant trajectories across stages, enabling accurate distribution learning and full end-to-end optimization, which is parameterized as a single DiT, ensuring knowledge sharing and eliminating disjoint modules.
